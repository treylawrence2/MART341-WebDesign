The different between padding, margin, and borders is when and how youre using them. Padding is used around pictures or paragraphs usually for a more appealing looking picture. Margin refers to the empty space between a paragraph or picture and the edge of the screen/page. A border is similar to padding, it is used to look visually more appealing.
