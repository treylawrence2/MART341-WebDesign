  <b>Welcome to Lawrence Basketball Academy</b>,  We are a year round basketball training program for 4th graders-12th graders. Our goal is to develop kids not just into talented athletes on the corut but also to develop high character individuals off the court.
  We travel around the state and country playing and particpating in some of the best tournaments against some of the toughest competion. Some of the keys to our programs success includes having dedicated and committed trainers and coaches that really strive to be the best they can be the same way we hope our athletes do.
