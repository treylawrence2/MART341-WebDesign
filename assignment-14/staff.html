  <h2> Trey Lawrence - Owner, Coach, Trainer </h2>
  <p>
    Trey Lawrence unofficially founded Lawrence Basketball Academy back in the spring of 2020, Lawrence was excited to start a new Spring AAU season with his newly picked team. In March, the Covid-19 Pnademic quickly shut down any plans of traveling and competeing that spring and summer. What started as at home, in your garage work outs together as a team on Zoom eventually moved a little bit more back to normal when we went to out door courts 2 times a week at various Western Washington Middle Schools and Elementrary Schools. When we moved to train backoutside we had 6 that were willing to at the time. Through word of mouth by the end of that same summer Lawrence was able to field a 5th grade group training session, a 6th grade group training session, and a 7th grade group training session. Each group with 6 or 7 kids that would consistently show up time and time again, and that was truly the start of Lawrence Basketball Academy.
<br>
<br>
    Lawrence had a fairly successful playing career, following a near fatal TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) at the end of his sophomore year of high school, he was forced to take most of his Junior year off to recover. Lawrence came back in full his senior year, averaging nearly 18 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 assists a game. Lawrence was named First team All-League, First team All-Area, as well as Second Team All-State for his performance. He led Glacier Peak to a 21-6 record and the schools first State Quarterfinal appearance since 2011. Following his HS career, Lawrence ended up at Yakima Valley College (WA) for a short time prior to transfering to Bellevue College (WA) where he would play 1 season for them. After a not so successful season at Bellevue, Lawrence joined the team at the University of Montana. He still currently plays there and plans to continue his coaching career following the end of his collegiate elligibility.</p>
